                        <p>When you create an account on our website, buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and (Us).</p>
                        <p>In order to carry out (Our) obligations under that contract we must process the information you give (Us). Some of this information may be personal information.</p>
                        <p>We may use it in order to:</p>

                        <p>We process this information on the basis there is a contract between us, or that you have requested we use the information before we enter into a legal contract.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, we may aggregate this information in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor our performance with respect to a particular service we provide. If we use it for this purpose, you as an individual will not be personally identifiable.</p>
                        <p>We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.</p>

                        <p>Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our website or ask us to provide you more information about our business, including job opportunities and our products and services, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.</p>
                        <p>Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information, for example, by asking you to agree to our use of cookies.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes you might give your consent implicitly, such as when you send us a message by e-mail to which you would reasonably expect us to reply.</p>
                        <p>Except where you have consented to our use of your information for a specific purpose, we do not use your information in any way that would identify you personally. We may aggregate it in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor the performance of a particular page on our website.</p>
                        <p>If you have given us explicit permission to do so, we may from time to time pass your name and contact information to selected associates whom we consider may provide services or products you would find useful.</p>
                        <p>We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent, or it can be reasonably assumed that your consent no longer exists.</p>
                        <p>You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us via email <a href="mailto:Admin@thequackapp.com" className="underline text-blue-400">Admin@thequackapp.com</a></p>

                        <p>We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so. Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having considered:</p>
                        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-5 space-y-1 text-lg">
                            <li>whether the same objective could be achieved through other means.</li>

                            <li>whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to do so.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of:</p>

                        <p>For example, we may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order. This may include your personal information. </p>
